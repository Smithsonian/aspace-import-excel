   + **Otherwise, if you want the first Archival Object in your list to be inserted as a sibling/child (see "Hierarchical Relationship" below) of an already-existing Archival Object, select that object from the tree.  The page will reload to that Archival Object, again presenting you with the "Load via Spreadsheet" button.
 
3. Click on the button.  You will see a Load Spreadsheet popup, with the rest of the page "greyed out"
