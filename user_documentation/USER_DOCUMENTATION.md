   + **Otherwise**, if you want the first Archival Object in your list to be inserted as a sibling/child (see <a href="#hier">Hierarchical Relationship</a>, below) of an already-existing Archival Object, select that object from the tree.  The page will reload to that Archival Object, again presenting you with the "Load via Spreadsheet" button.
 
3. Click on the button.  You will see a Load Spreadsheet popup, with the rest of the page "greyed out"
4. Click on "Add File" to browse and locate a file on your system.  Select the Excel File.
5. Once you've identified the file, click on **"Import from SpreadSheet"**. The Ingester will start; the rest of the page will continue to be "greyed out". 
6. When the ingest is finished, there will be an alert pop-up. 
7. Click to close the popup, and you will be presented with a report of the processing.
8. You can click on "Copy to clipboard" to get a tabbed version of the report to examine and/or save.
