# aspace-import-excel
An [ArchivesSpace ](http://archivesspace.org/ "ArchivesSpace") plugin to support the bulk uploading via Excel SpreadSheet of Archival Objects and (optionally) their associated Creator Agents, Top Containers, Locations, Subjects, etc.

Initial development will support interactive selection of an archival object (or resource) as the starting point of the bulk upload.  

The Excel template will be found in the templates/ folder as **archival_objects_interactive.xsl**.  As we expand this plugin to support background job bulk-ingest, there may be more templates provided.

More details *tbd*.
